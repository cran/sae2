Description: Time series area-level models for small area estimation. 
      The package supplements the functionality of the sae package.
      Specifically, it includes EBLUP fitting of the original Rao-Yu model, 
      which in the original form did not have a spatial component. The 
      package also offers a modified ('dynamic') version of the Rao-Yu model, 
      replacing the assumption of stationarity. Both univariate and 
      multivariate applications are supported. Of particular note is the 
      allowance for covariance of the area-level sample estimates over time, 
      as encountered in rotating panel designs such as the U.S. National 
      Crime Victimization Survey or present in a time-series of 5-year 
      estimates from the American Community Survey. Key references to the 
      methods include
